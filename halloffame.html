        <p><b>Aviary</b></p>
        <p>This outpost of Grant Achatz’s acclaimed Chicago experimental cocktail bar, located on the 35th floor of the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Columbus Circle, 
          strikes awe with both view and its high prices. But the liquid concoctions, which reach north of $25, are worthy as a splurge. A Manhattan riff called the “wake and bake,”
          for example, is infused with coffee and sealed in a bag with everything-bagel scent that perfumes the air. Sip while peering over rushed shoppers for ultimate schadenfreude.</p>
